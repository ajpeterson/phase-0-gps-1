What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Learning how to upload to GitHub was a little confusing, merging and such.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Basically everything about branching, and learning how to merge existing branches with the current one. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked them about their experience with Git/Hub, and how to ask for help when it was needed. 

What still confuses you about Git?

I'm pretty comfortable with Git.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I really enjoyed it, and I am looking forward to our next session together.
