# GPS 1.1 Reflection

## Questions

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
  Prior to the GPS I was struggling with the workflow of merging, pushing from Git to GitHub and then confirming a pull request and merging. I think one thing that was tripping me up was that you can work on the same file in different branches. I had been creating new files for changes which caused multiple files to show up in the repo rather than one file with all of the changes merged.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
  The entire workflow process was clarified, but in particular going through the pull request and merging changes on GitHub. Also, the concept of creating feature branches and making updates to the same file was clarified.

* **What questions did you ask of your pair and guide?**
  I asked for clarification of git checkout and git checkout -b and the difference between them. My pair and I also asked of each other and talked through why merge conflicts happen and why we use feature branches.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**
  Honestly, a lot of it is making sense. The entire workflow of creating a repo (is it best to create locally or remotely), creating branches, adding and committing changes and then pushing to GitHub and navigating through the pull request and merging is still a bit confusing although much clearer after today. I think it is just one of those things were the more I practice the better it will get.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
  My first experience in a GPS was quite enjoyable. Prior to starting I was nervous I as I had not done anything like this before. I felt like we communicated and listened to each other well. When we had questions we helped each other and got some assistance from our guide. I think the pairing certainly furthered my knowledge of Git and GitHub and the workflow substantially more than if I done this challenge on my own. I am looking forward to the next one.
